# ZUMspot_Update

This repo contains two bash scripts that allow you to flash firmware onto your ZUMspot Duplex Kit or ZUMspot Dualband Kit. Script only works on a Raspberry Pi running Pi-Star.

The firmware on here was built using the MMDVM_HS repo from CA6JAU https://github.com/juribeparada/MMDVM_HS

# USE

To update the firmware on your ZUMspot Duplex Kit or ZUMspot Dualband Kit, download the respective bash script. So if you have a ZUMspot Duplex Kit you would download the install_fw_duplex.sh script. The script will handle the rest. For detailed information see the documentation linked below.
